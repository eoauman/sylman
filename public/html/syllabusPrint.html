            <p class="center-text strong-bg">Course Technologies</p>
            <p>This course requires the use of Canvas to access materials and submit assignments. Some videos posted via Canvas will require the use of speakers or headphones. The instructor may utilize web-conferencing tools to deliver synchronous material. In order to participate in synchronous sessions (should they exist), you should have a computer, a webcam, headphones, and microphone.</p>
            <p>This course requires the use of Microsoft Office (i.e., Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Students can gain access to these materials by visiting Office 365.</p>
            <p>Students should check their email daily for course updates.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>All students are required to comply with Jefferson University&rsquo;s Computer and Network Security Policy.</p>

            <p class="center-text strong-bg">Netiquette</p>

            <p>Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience.
