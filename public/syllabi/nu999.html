                <p class="section-title">COVID-19 Syllabus Addendum</p>
                <p>Jefferson and its educational leaders recognize the importance of regular class attendance and the benefits to student learning. Faculty determine the most appropriate attendance policies to support learning outcomes in their class and state these policies on their course syllabus. Some Accrediting Agencies determine and set minimum standards for attendance in clinical settings. Students recognize the importance of attendance and make every effort to be present for classes and participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in accordance with guidance from the CDC, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Department of Education, and the City of Philadelphia’s Department of Public Health, Jefferson is adopting a more flexible approach to student absenteeism for the 2020-2021 academic year. In order to protect the health and safety of our community while ensuring continuity of learning, in-person classes shall adhere to the following directives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who are symptomatic (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell), who believe they have had recent possible exposure to COVID-19, or who have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 should not come to class in person. Those students should contact Student Health in East Falls or the Jefferson Occupational Health Network (JOHN) in Center City for guidance on steps to take.</li>
                    <li>Accommodations should be made (e.g., extended due dates, electronic submission of assignments), when possible, for individuals who may be temporarily unable to attend class due to possible exposure or illness from COVID-19. Students should make every attempt to stay current on their work during this time. Faculty will allow students to attend classes remotely in these instances whenever possible.&nbsp;<br />If a student is unable to attend class, they should engage in active and regular communication with faculty. This includes informing faculty in advance of class about the need to be absent and ensuring regular ongoing communication should absences continue.</li>
                    <li>Faculty and students should follow the process established by Student Health and Jefferson Occupational Health Network regarding potential exposure or illness from COVID-19 for both classroom and clinical attendance.</li>
                    <li>Faculty will be flexible about in-person attendance to the greatest extent possible in order to maximize adherence to Jefferson health and safety guidelines. To that end, faculty will utilize Canvas and other technologies to the greatest extent practicable to post course materials and other relevant information, to enable students who may be required to be absent to continue with coursework. Faculty and students should be aware that a certain level of absenteeism will disrupt continuity of teaching, learning, and research and should consult other policies, such as Medical Leave of Absence or Incompletes as needed.</li>
                    <li>Faculty and students should practice social distancing, mask wearing, and hand hygiene as directed in the guidelines.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students and faculty should consult their Chair or Program Director as needed for guidance on attendance considerations relative to grading. If necessary, the Dean of Students or Office of Student Affairs can assist.</p>
